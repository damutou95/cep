Your Google Chrome browser has a hidden game … and its VERY addictive
The crafty geeks at Google have snuck an addictive running game into its hugely popular Chrome browser.
The endless runner can be accessed whenever your computer drops its internet connection.
Hitting the spacebar whenever Chrome flashes up its "Unable to connect to the Internet" warning – the little dinosaur mascot will spring to life.
Losing your wifi is always frustrating – but this hidden gem certainly helps to ease the pain.
Tapping the spacebar makes the sprinting dinosaur jump.
As the course gradually speeds up, obstacles will increase in frequency and you'll find yourself nervously hammering the spacebar.
A High Score counter also appears in the top-right of the browser window – and keeps track of your progress.
The endless running game is a great little time waster, but its not the first time Google has hidden a game inside its products.
The search giant recently added the ability to play seminal 1980s arcade game Pac-Man in its Maps service.
Pac-Man was available to play online and through an updated version of the iOS and Android mobile apps on April Fools Day this year.
Google Chrome is a great browser – but can slow your computer to slog.
Earlier this week, a new Chrome extension was released which promised to speed up your PC – by freezing any unused tabs in your browser.
Keeping a selection of tabs open in your internet browser can really bog down your computer's performance
The new – and free – Chrome browser extension dubbed Great Suspender hopes to solve the issue.
The lightweight plug-in freezes tabs when you are not actively using them.
This prevents the tabs from chugging away at your computer performance behind-the-scenes and reduces the browser's memory footprint.
