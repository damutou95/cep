A ceremony was held on March 1st by the Saigon Transportation Mechanical Corporation (SAMCO) to hand over 23 CNG-powered buses to the Ho Chi Minh City-based ‘May 19’ Bus Transport Cooperative. SAMCO is a state-owned enterprise, with its main operations involving the production of transport mechanical products and the provision of high-quality transport services.
“The buses are SAMCO’s first shipment of a 300-bus purchase by the People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City,” said Tran Quoc Toan, general director at SAMCO. “They are also the flagships of environmentally friendly vehicles suitable for public transport in such metropolises like Ho Chi Minh City.”
These buses will join the existing fleet of bus route 33, which shuttles between An Suong Station in Hoc Mon District and the Vietnam National University-Ho Chi Minh City in Thu Duc District, making the whole fleet of 52 buses 100% environmentally-friendly.
Nguyen Van Trieu, director at ‘May 19’ Bus Transport Cooperative, said VND63 billion (US$2.8 million) was spent on these buses, coming from investments by its members, reported local newspaper Tuoi Tre.
