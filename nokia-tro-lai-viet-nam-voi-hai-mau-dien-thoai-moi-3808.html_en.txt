Nokia to come back to Vietnam with two new phone models
Nokia will return to the global market, including Vietnam later this year with two new phone models, according to distributor FPT Trading.
Nokia will return to the mobile phone market later this year. This information was confirmed during a meeting between representatives of Microsoft (currently owns the rights to exploit the brand Nokia but is about to transfer to the Global HMD) and the distributor FPT Trading last week.
According to James Rutherfoord, CEO of mobile device commodities of Microsoft Asia - Pacific, HMD Global (the owner of Nokia commercial rights for 10 years) planned to launch two new phone products in the fourth quarter 2016 and at least two smartphones in the early second quarter 2017.
Currently, the basic phone manufacturing factory of Microsoft in Bac Ninh, Vietnam, is managed by FIH Mobile, a subsidiary of Foxconn. This plant can directly produce two new Nokia phones, which are expected to be launched later this year.
Meanwhile, representatives of retailers in Vietnam said Nokia and Microsoft had not made any contact with agents.
In May, unnamed sources from the partner that recruits personnel in Vietnam for Microsoft Mobile told Zing.vn that this firm ended contracts with hundreds of salespeople, technicians and managers from June 1.
However, Microsoft Mobileâ€™s termination of its contracts staff in Vietnam does not mean that Microsoft Mobile is about to stop operating in Vietnam. 
On its official website, Microsoft Vietnam confirmed that Microsoft will continue to develop Windows 10 Mobile and support Lumia phones like Lumia 650, Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL, as well as devices from its original equipment manufacturers (OEM) such as Acer, Alcatel, HP, Trinity and VAIO.
