Hanoi student suspended for insulting teacher on Facebook
The school has not said why or what the 12th grader posted, but the media said she was unhappy with the low scores the teacher gave her.
Le Loi High School in Hanoi has suspended for 10 days a student for insulting her teacher on Facebook.
The student, identified only as Q of class 12A6, will have her violation noted in her school record, and had to write a report on the case.
Q admitted to her wrongdoing and apologized to the teacher.
The school board did not elaborate on the reason for Qâ€™s Facebook attack, but the media has claimed that she was frustrated with the teacher for giving her low scores.
In 2013 an eighth grader in Tam Ky town was suspended for a full year for insulting her school and teachers on her Facebook page.
Ly Tu Trong Secondary School later rescinded the decision following widespread criticism for its harshness.
But in its wake, many schools around the country issued regulations on what students can and cannot post on Facebook.
