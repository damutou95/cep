Majority want metro station near Hoàn Kiếm Lake
This was revealed by Lê Trung Hiếu, deputy head of Hà Nội Metro Railway Management Board. 
The C9 metro underground station is part of the metro line No. 2 connecting Nam Thăng Long and Trần Hưng Đạo street.
Some 60 per cent of the feedback was contributed by people between the ages of 22 and 60, of which 88 per cent of respondents were Vietnamese, while the rest were foreigners.
Nearly 40 per cent of surveyed people are residents living near Hoàn Kiếm Lake, the potential location of underground station C9.
The master plan of underground station C9 has been opened to the public from March 9 to 31.
The station is planned to be located at km9+864,645 under the flower garden by Hoàn Kiếm Lake on Đinh Tiên Hoàng Street with three floors, including a concourse level, a technical area and a platform level. 
The shortest distance from the station to Hoàn Kiếm Lake is some 10m. According to the initial design, the station will have four gates.
Hiếu said that the metro line No. 2 would connect with line No.1, Ngọc Hồi – Như Quỳnh, at C8 station on Hàng Đậu Street and line No. 3, Nhổn – Hoàng Mai, at station C10 on Hàng Bài Street.
The metro line No. 2 has a length of 11.5km with a depot of 17.5ha located in Xuân Đỉnh Ward, Bắc Từ Liêm District. 
The entire metro line has 10 stations, including three elevated stations and seven underground stations.
The investment in the project has been pegged at VNĐ34.690 trillion (US$1.5 billion) allocated from the Japanese government’s official development assitance and the reciprocal capital is from the State budget. — VNS
