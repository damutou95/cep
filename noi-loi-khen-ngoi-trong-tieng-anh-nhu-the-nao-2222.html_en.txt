How to pay a compliment in English?
One of the nicest things you can do in any language is to compliment someone. You might want to compliment someone on what they did, how they look or what they have. Here are forms and phrases to compliment others in English. I've arranged compliments into complimenting ability, complimenting looks, and complimenting possessions in both formal and informal situations.
1- Complimenting Ability 
Use these phrases to compliment someone on an ability they have.
If you'd like to learn something from the person about his / her ability, start with a compliment. The person will probably help you learn more and be happy to talk about how to do it.
Formal
Informal
2- Complimenting Looks
Use these phrases to compliment someone on how they look. I've divided this into two categories: for women and for men.
It's important to use the right language for the situation. If you pay someone a compliment on their looks in the wrong way, it's possible that your compliment will not be accepted.
Formal
Informal
3- Complimenting Possessions
Use these phrases to compliment someone on something they have. People are often proud of their possessions, especially major objects such as a house, a car, or even a stereo system. Complimenting someone on a nice possession is a good way to make small talk.
