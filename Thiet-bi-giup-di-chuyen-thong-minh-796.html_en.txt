This is the Lopifit. It's not an electric bike, it's not a scooter, it's not a treadmill. It's all three combined.
Bruin Bergmeester lives in a small village in Holland and has built all of his five Lopifit prototypes in his living room.
When asked how he came up with the idea, Bruin explains he works full time and sits all day, so he likes to exercise on a treadmill at home.
One day it was lovely outside and Bruin did not fancy spending time on a bicycle, which meant sitting again, so he thought to himself: "Why not bring the treadmill outdoors?" And so the Lopifit was born.
When you put your foot on the belt and push it backwards, it makes the shaft turn. Sensors register the movement and send a signal to a computer, situated near the storage battery, which then makes a motor turn.
Being electrical, the Lopifit runs quite fast and is equally good going uphill. It is suited for all ages, all leg lengths, and all physical conditions.
A bicycle maker from Holland, Utrecht, is available to build them on demand.
Bruin says he is looking for a manufacturer in the States, so give him a call now, what are you waiting for?
