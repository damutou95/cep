European language festival to be held in Vietnam
A European language festival will take place in Hanoi on October 21 under the theme ‘Internationalisation: Challenges and Opportunities for School in Vietnam’.
The festival provides a special opportunity for teachers and lecturers at schools and universities as well as the public to get an insight into European linguistic and cultural diversity.
Representatives of the six organising EUNIC institutions and the Ministry of Education and Training will highlight opportunities and challenges for schools in Vietnam to enhance international contact in a morning conference.
The session provides a fantastic opportunity for up to 120 experts on teaching foreign languages, lecturers and teachers to listen to talks by international speakers.
The representatives, lecturers and teachers will also present and discuss their experience.
In the afternoon, European Day of Languages will open to anyone interested in European languages.
Students, parents and anyone interested in languages and culture will be able to learn new languages in classrooms through games.
Trial classes will be offered to enable participants to learn some words in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
No registration is required for the afternoon portion of the festival, with entrance to all events free.
The event is held annually by the European Union National Institutes of Culture (EUNIC).
