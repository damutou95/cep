How do I learn English?
Hello, I don't know where I should begin. I'm Hung, a student of University of Kelaniya. I've been studying abroad for over 6 years and English is one of languages that I can use well (I do not dare to put the word "fluently" here). =)))
As mentioned in my introduction, I've been abroad for that long till now and worked with international students from various countries. And I found that we can memorize an English word faster than other foreigner students, you know why? Because, we have an advantage of using Latin alphabet in our language. You know why I tell you this, please stop complaining about the difficulty of memorizing an English word.
So, let's get to the point, the first thing that you've got to do is 'let's learn to speak English as a British or an American". As you know, in high-school or in your English course, you speak some basic sentences in an old way. Why don't you try to change this bad habit? Some examples:
  – You want to ask your classmate, his/her name. In the old way, following the school book, you may say that "what's your name?" and that guy responds 'my name is blah, blah". You see, the old habit, we use English like a machine. Just imagine! One nice day, come to class, and ask "hi there, may I have your name, please?". Or nudge a new friend or new comer sitting beside you and ask "hey! Dude, you got a name?, or how do I address you?".
   – Another example, just imagine a situation, you forgot your phone, you left your watch at home, or you want to make a new friend and you try to ask his or her about the time, you may say that in the same old way "what time is it now?". Why don't we try to change this habit by saying this "excuse me, do you have the time?" You see, two questions with the same meaning. 
Second point is about the pronunciation. A good pronunciation makes you feel more confident, and a wrong pronunciation may lead to a misunderstanding. I give you an example:
   – You were invited to come to your friend's house. You see a cake on the table and you ask: "Do you mind if I have a piece?". But a wrong pronunciation can make his or her confused, he or she may hear that "Do you mind if I have a piss?". You see, a piece and a piss.
Third one, is how to develop our listening skill. Personally, I think a good pronunciation will help us to develop our listening skill. According to my experience, I practice my listening skill by watching movie with "serial episodes." And it works! By this way, I learned how to respond correctly for each situation. Example:
   – One day, a friend offers you to go out for dinner or to talk over coffee. Mostly, you may say that "thank you, I love it, or I like". So, have you ever thought how a local guy will say in this case instead of saying 'yes' or 'I love it'? As I as I know, If an American agree, he/she will say "How can I refuse, or how can I turn you down!". 
   – And if you want to say "no"; don't say "no", "I don't want" or "something like that". Or you want to go in another appropriate time, you can say that "Oh, sorry, can you give me a rain check, please?". By the way, I don't teach you how to tell a white lie, but be polite and don't hurt others.
Fourth, you should use idioms in the right situation and sometimes, we can compare to Vietnamese idioms to make our study to be more interesting. Example:
   – Sometime, when you have a free time for chit-chat with friends. In the conversation, please put some idioms.
      A: Ryan, Alice is absent today, what a strange, once in a blue moon.
      B: You know what, she's just broken up with her boyfriend. He treats her bad.
      A: What? He's very handsome.
      B: Come on! You can never tell a book by its cover.
The last one is, when you learn a new word, try to look up its definition in English, get its synonym and antonym. And the most important thing is how to put it into phrases or sentences. For example:
Abandon is a verb, and then you learn more about its definition in dictionary. Then, look for the collocations of it, like
   – abandon a child, baby
   – an abandoned building, warehouse
   – hastily/ abruptly abandon something or someone
Its synonyms are: desert, leave
Its antonyms are: continue, preserve, etc.
Finally, this is all my method of learning English. Until now, I learn English every day. I bought some time to share you my experience and actually, I'm very busy with doing assignments. Bottom line, remember this "when there is will, there is a way".
