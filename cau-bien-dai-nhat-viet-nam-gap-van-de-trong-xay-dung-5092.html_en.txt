Vietnam longest sea bridge suffers construction problems
 Problems during the construction of the Vietnam's longest sea bridge slated to open to traffic in August this year have been detected.
Tan Vu-Lach Huyen Bridge
The government’s inspection task force has announced results of a check on Tan Vu-Lach Huyen Bridge, Vietnam’s longest cross-sea bridge, located in the northern city of Haiphong. 
According to the task force, up to 94% of the project has been completed and the bridge is scheduled to open next month. However, the inspection found many problems related to the bridge construction quality.
Water stagnation has been seen at some sections of the bridge; meanwhile, the bridge surface is not flat as regulated, which was attributed to the quality of concrete and asphalt.
The task force has detected cracks in some lane girders. One girder is 5cm higher than others. This poses difficulties for the repair when the girder connection has been finished.
Part of the bridge near the Cam River has faced the subsidence when compared to the design of the project.
The government’s inspection task force has requested the project management board to instruct contractors and project supervising and consulting firms to ensure the construction quality.
Speaking with DTiNews, Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Van Cong said that the project is still underway, so a number of items have not yet been completed, noting that the ministry will ask contractors as well as consulting and supervising units to deal with the problems pointed out by the government’s inspection task force.
Tan Vu-Lach Huyen Bridge will cost VND11.85 trillion (USD530 million). The bridge is 5.44km long and 16 metres wide with six lanes, linking Trang Cat Ward in Hai An District with Lach Huyen Port in Cat Hai Island District.
