Vietnamese young accountant wins ‘New Zealand, New Horizon’ contest
The winner says she will save the prize, a trip to New Zealand, for her parents.
A 23-year-old Vietnamese woman has won the “New Zealand, New Horizon” competition held by the New Zealand Embassy in Hanoi, which aims to increase knowledge and understanding between the two countries. 
With her entry “Magical Dream,” Nguyen Thanh Hang won a trip to New Zealand for two, which she gave to her parents.
“I have never been to New Zealand before but in my eyes New Zealand is a very green and peaceful country,” she said. 
In her video, Hang, an accountant in Quang Nam Province, used animation to flesh out what it would be like for her parents to visit popular destinations in New Zealand. 
In about three weeks, more than 200 articles, videos, poems and photos about many different aspects of New Zealand were submitted to the competition. 
“We received a great number of quality entries which really underscored the strong interest in and knowledge about New Zealand and the relationship between New Zealand and Vietnam,” New Zealand Ambassador to Vietnam Haike Manning said.
The two second prizes, each consists of a night for two and a lunch at a five star hotel either in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh city, were awarded to Nguyen Tran Duong Minh with his entry “Knighton school with memories” and Doan Thien Hoa Nghiem with “I love New Zealand”.
The two third prizes, each includes a lunch for two at a five star hotel either in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, went to Vu Dieu Huong with “My story” and Truong Thi Bich Chung with “A dream of exploration”.
The second annual competition was part of the New Zealand Embassy’s activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations and friendship between New Zealand and Vietnam.
