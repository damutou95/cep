The Hanoi’s People Committee said investors registering for projects are Vingroup, Xuan Thanh Group, the Lung Lo 5 Joint Stock Company, Mosmetrotroy (Russia), Tan Hoang Minh Group, Licogi MIK Group, and Lotte Group (South Korea).
The lines are Line 1 (Ngoc Hoi - Yen Vien - Nhu Quynh), Line 2 (Noi Bai - Thuong Dinh - Buoi), Line 3 (Cat Linh - Ha Dong - Xuan Mai), Line 4 (Troi- Nhon - Yen So), Line 5 (Me Linh - Sai Dong - Lien Ha), Line 6 (Van Cao - Hoa Lac), Line 7 (Noi Bai - Ngoc Hoi), Line 8 (Me Linh - Ha Dong), Line 9 (Son Dong - Mai Dich - Duong Xa), and Line 10 (Son Tay - Hoa Lac - Xuan Mai).
Based on directions from the Prime Minister, the People’s Committee will focus on directing selected investors to complete pre-feasibility studies for submission to the government before August 30. Projects will then be submitted to the National Assembly for approval at the end of this year.
Hanoi has also proposed adding the 6,000 ha of land to the land use planning for 2011-2020, raising VND300 trillion ($13.2 billion) in reciprocal capital.
