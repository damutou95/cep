Hanoi has confirmed that it will host the 31st Southeast Asian Games in 2021, promising to organize the sporting event economically. 
The capital city said Monday that it has submitted a plan to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the General Department of Sports. 
Current facilities will be upgraded to serve the event and no new facility will be built, as instructed by Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. 
According to the 80-page plan, a total of more than VND1.74 trillion (US$78 million) will be spent on the event. 
Nearly VND1 trillion will be earmarked for organizing activities and the rest for upgrading relevant facilities, including the My Dinh Sports Complex and Aquatic Sports Center. Other venues in nearby provinces can also be used. 
Total revenue is expected to be nearly VND97 billion, including contributions from 10 other participating countries, sponsors, advertisement and broadcast rights. That is around 5.6 percent of the investment.  
Hanoi hosted the 22nd SEA Games in 2003 and the Asian Indoor Games in 2009. 
The 31st SEA Games will be held for the last two weeks of November 2021, with more than 10,000 participants and 36 sports. 
Vietnam is targeting the first place in the medal standings.
