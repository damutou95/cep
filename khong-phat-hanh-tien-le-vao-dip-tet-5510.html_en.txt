The announcement was made by SBV Deputy Governor Đào Minh Tú at a press meeting in Hà Nội on Monday.
Currently, bills with small face values are mainly used as donation money, and not as a means of payment. As a Tết tradition, Vietnamese usually donate money in small denominations to pagodas and temples to wish for luck in the New Year.
This will be the fifth year that new banknotes of VNĐ5,000 denomination are not printed and it will help save some VNĐ280 billion for the State budget, the central bank estimated.
The central bank has not issued new, small banknotes of VNĐ500, VNĐ1,000 and VNĐ2,000 denomination since 2013, which has helped save roughly VNĐ2.2 trillion for the State budget, Tú said, adding that the policy has so far been received positively by the public.
He said the central bank will also collaborate with relevant ministries and agencies to better manage note exchange services. According to a current regulation, illegal note exchange services can be fined between VNĐ20 and 40 million.
In a bid to secure the supply of cash for Tết, the central bank has already instructed its branches nationwide to review the cash demand and ensure that the branches are well-prepared, with enough cash to supply to the local State treasuries and credit institutions.
The central bank also requires credit institutions, which have ATMs, to ensure that demand for cash withdrawals is met.
This year’s Tết holiday, which is the largest traditional holiday for the Vietnamese, will begin on February 15.
