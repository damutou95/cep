You'll Be Able To Use Google Map Offline Later This Year
A recent announcement by the folks at Google is exciting news for any frequent travelers who’ve experienced the frustration of getting lost in a strange place with no access to internet. According to their international office, Google Maps will begin offering users access to offline maps.
While users are already able to save maps so they can reference them later, this new version will also include all the other important features Google Maps offers. In addition to perusing maps, travellers can also find hours of operation, read reviews, and even get turn-by-turn directions.
This new development is huge for someone like me who relies heavily on Google Maps when I’m out scouting properties in remote locations in Latin America, where cellular and internet service is sometimes spotty. Although Google hasn’t announced a definite rollout date, they say the new features will hit devices later this year.
The new Google Maps with offline access is sure to be well received by anyone with a penchant for travel and exploration. It can’t get here fast enough for me.
