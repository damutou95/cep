Major lender Vietcombank has announced that it no longer allows money transfers to foreign cardholders via its ATMs.  
The bank said in a statement on its website that the new policy is in accordance with a central bank's order. All foreign clients will be affected by the rule.  
A customer service employee at the bank said on the phone that foreigners can still use their cards to withdraw money received from a transfer via a bank office or the Internet, as long as it is not made via an ATM.  
Foreign banks operating in Vietnam such as ANZ, HSBC and Citibank are still offering the ATM transfer service for foreigners, so as other major Vietnamese lenders such as DongA and Agribank.
