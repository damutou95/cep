New line would cut trip to 45 minutes compared to three hours by road.
Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City are working with their counterparts in Mekong Delta provinces and especially those in the local hub of Can Tho city to review the construction of the Ho Chi Minh City - Can Tho railway line, which if approved would provide a significant boost to local development.
At speeds of 200 km/h, travel time on the new line would be shortened to 45 minutes from the three hours it now takes by road.
The line is expected to run parallel to National Highway No.1 and pass through a series of emerging urban areas that cover some 11,720 sq km and are home to 14 million people.
The project was originally aimed at alleviating the high transport demand on roads and waterways. It will also have a positive impact on the socioeconomic development of the two cities as well as neighboring provinces such as Long An, Tien Giang, and Vinh Long provinces.
Total investment is estimated about $5 billion and the line may be completed and opened by the end of 2024.
According to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), by 2030, the volume of passenger and freight transport from Ho Chi Minh City to Can Tho will increase 4.8-fold and three-fold compared to 2008. Ho Chi Minh City is the center of the southern key economic region while Can Tho is the center of the key economic region in the Mekong Delta. The new railway line would connect the two major centers and bolster economic development and national defense and security.
