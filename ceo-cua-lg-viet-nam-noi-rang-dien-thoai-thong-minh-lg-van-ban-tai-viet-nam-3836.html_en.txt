Recently, some local newspapers reported that LG would stop distributing smartphones in Vietnam. The sources said the retail systems of the official distributors of LG smartphones have no longer offered LG phones.
CEO Kim yesterday confirmed that LG is still growing well in Vietnam and the company will not abandon the Vietnamese market. 
He said that LG Mobile will still distribute its products in the Vietnamese market via strategic business partners.
He said LG is undergoing restructuring with the new strategy on personnel, processes and product distribution. This has caused misunderstandings and the above rumors.
According to June data of the market research firm GfK, LG for the first time did not appear in the statistics of the phone market due to low sales. 
The cause, according to experts, is that LG brought only a few smartphone models to Vietnam. The firm also had to compete with the giants likes Samsung, Apple or the new comer Oppo.
