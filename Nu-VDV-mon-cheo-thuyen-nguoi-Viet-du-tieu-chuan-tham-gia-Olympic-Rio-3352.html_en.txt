Hue, 26, came in second place in the women’s Single Sculls during the semi-final round, with a time of 8min 0.53sec, and qualified for the Brazilian Olympics this summer.
“Hue ranked sixth in the first round and was one of 12 athletes entering the semifinals. In the semis she took the lead from the beginning, though a host rower jumped ahead in the final 100m, which was enough for her to take her own Olympic ticket,” said Nguyen Hai Duong, head of the rowing department of the National Sports Administration.
Today, Hue will take part in the final, while teammates Pham Thi Thao and Ta Thanh Huyenh compete in the women’s lightweight double sculls.
