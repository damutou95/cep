Vietnamese watch even more YouTube this year, now in world's top 10
The time local users spend on YouTube surged 120 percent from a year ago, new statistics show
New statistics released by Google show that Vietnamese have become more active on YouTube, spending more time watching and uploading videos.  
Local media reported that the country has made it to the global top 10 in terms of YouTube watch time. Although details are not available, Google, the owner of YouTube, said the watch time increased 120 percent compared to a year ago.  
Nguyen Phuong Anh, marketing director of Google in Vietnam, said the local users have also uploaded more videos on the site. 
Anh said 400 hours of videos have been uploaded in Vietnam every minute since 2014. The number of videos posted in Vietnam has surged 235 percent over the past year, she said, as cited by news website Saigon Times Online.
Notably, many commercials garnered a large number of views, with the top ten most popular ads achieving a combined 50 million views within a year. An eight-minute video for an online shopping website topped the list.  
An earlier survey by the Ministry of Industry and Trade found that more than 35 million Vietnamese are Internet users and more than half of those now shop online. 
The number of people using social media sites for shopping increased to 53 percent in 2014 from 45 percent the previous year, it said.
