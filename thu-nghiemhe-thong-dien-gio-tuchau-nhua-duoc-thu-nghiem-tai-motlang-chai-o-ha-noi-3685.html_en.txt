Plastic basin wind power systems pilot project tested in fishing village in Hà Nội
Four blades made from plastic basins, erected on steel pillars and propelled by wind power, are providing electricity for families in a village located near Hà Nội. 
Propelled by wind power, blades made from plastic basins erected on steel pillars are providing electricity for families in a fishing village on the Red River near Hà Nội.
The power systems are installed on boats owned by households in the Sứ fishing village on the Hồng River off Tây Hồ District, Hà Nội.
The system’s measured wind speed is 3 metres per second, sufficient to generate electricity, which is stored in battery accumulators.
One resident in the village told online Zing.vn newspaper that the wind turbines turn all day, generating enough electricity for a 9-watt LED light for four to five hours.
Most of the 10 families earn a living by transporting pottery or buying waste materials.
Before the environmentally friendly system was installed, the families’s power costs were VNĐ200,000-VNĐ300,000 (US$8.9-$13.3) each month.
An interior architecture company, which does not want to be named, installed the system in co-operation with non-governmental organisations Plan International and Live & Learn in Việt Nam, and the Australian Agency for International Development.
