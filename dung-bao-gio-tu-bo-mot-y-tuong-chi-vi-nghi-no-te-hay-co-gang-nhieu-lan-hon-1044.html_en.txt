Don't give up on an idea because It's "Bad,"Â iterate it instead
Many of us have a tendency to think of ideas as "good" or "bad" ideas. However, more often than not, bad ideas are stepping stones to good ones. Sticking with the same idea may not be smart, but tweaking it can be incredibly useful.
Buffer founder Joel Gascoigne explains that ideas don't just go on one end of the "good/bad idea" spectrum or the other. They fit in the middle. Especially in corporate culture where time is money, it's tempting to give up on an idea once you realize it won't work. Joel suggests that iterating, modifying, or altering that idea may be a better solution:
Unfortunately, deadlines, budgets, and bosses still exist so it's not always possible to refine every idea. However, don't let the first road block slow you down. If you think there's something there in your idea, flesh it out a bit more. You never know where the road of creativity will take you.
