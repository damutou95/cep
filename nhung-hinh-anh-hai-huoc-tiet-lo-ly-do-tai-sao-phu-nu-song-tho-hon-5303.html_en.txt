Why women live longer revealed by hilarious images
Images have emerged on Imgur of men around the world wantonly risking their lives for the sake of completing a manual task. And having fun in a most hazardous manner.
Why women live longer revealed: Hilarious photographs show men demonstrating how NOT to stay alive.
The evidence is mounting.
Earlier this year MailOnline Travel revealed photographs that showed men in perilous situations of their own making, images that might help to explain why women live longer.
But there's more. 
Further images have emerged on Imgur of men around the world wantonly risking their lives for the sake of completing a manual task.
Or in the case of the group who put a trampoline on a terrace at the top of a block of flats, going about having fun in a manner that can only be described as hazardous.
File the photographs below under 'how not to stay alive'...    
Motorbikes? Check. Ladder? Check. Common sense? No where to be found
Yes, the light isn't easy to reach (left), but surely there had to be a better way. On the right is a contender for the world's most ill-advised trampoline location

Perhaps he read somewhere that being a risk-taker at work is a good thing... and just got a bit muddled
Well at least his hair is safe. Let's just hope there's no 'after' picture...
As if chainsaws weren't dangerous enough... (left). The worker on the right, meanwhile, is no bright spark
One hopes that the power was switched off at the mains
Erm, what could possibly go wrong? A lot, it has to be said
Mission implausible: Now it really is just getting silly
