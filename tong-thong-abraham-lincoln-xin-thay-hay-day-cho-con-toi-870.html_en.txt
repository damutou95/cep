Abraham Lincoln's letter to his son's teacher
He will have to learn, i know, that all men are not true. But teach him also that for every Scoundrel there is a hero, that for every selfish politian, there is a dedicated leader. 
Teach him that for every enemy there is a friend. 
Teach him that a dollar earn is of more value than five found.
Teach him to learn lose and to enjoy winning. Steer him away from envy if you can.
Teach him the secret of quiet laughter.
Teach him the wonder of books. But also give him quiet time to ponder the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on a green hillside.
Teach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if everyone tells him they are wrong. 
Teach him to be gentle with gentle people and tough with tough people.
Try to give him the strength on the bandwagon. 
Teach him to listen to all men but teach him also to filter all he hears on a screen of truth and take only the good that comes through.
Teach him how to laugh even when he is sad.
Teach him there is no shame in tears.
Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob and to stand and fight if he thinks he is right.
Teach him always to have sublime faith in his creator and faith in himself too, because then he will always have faith in man kind…
This is a big order, but see what you can do... He is such a fine fellow, my son!
