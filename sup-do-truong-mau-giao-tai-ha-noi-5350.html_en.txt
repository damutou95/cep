Kindergarten collapses in Hanoi
A kindergarten under construction in the capital city’s outer Nam Tu Liem District collapsed early Monday morning. No casualties have been reported.
A major portion of a kindergarten’s two-storey building collapses Monday morning. 
A large portion of a two-story concrete building of the Vuon Xanh (Green School) kindergarten, located on Tran Van Lai Street within the My Dinh-Me Tri urban area, collapsed at about 3am on Monday.
The district’s construction inspectors have been deployed to the accident scene for investigation, a district official told the Tien Phong (Vanguard) newspaper.
Nguyen Duc Chung, chairman of the Ha Noi People’s Committee, on Monday morning requested the district’s leaders to investigate the accident and report their findings to the city’s leader.
Located on 4,400sq.m land, construction of the kindergarten began in 2010 under a land rental agreement between the Ha Noi Department of Environmental and Natural Resources with its investor, according to the newspaper’s report. It was abandoned over the next few years and became a landfill.
Residents and voters of the districts had proposed several times to the city to confiscate the land to build markets and other public facilities.
In September 2016, upon request by the city’s environmental department, the Ha Noi People’s Committee gave its approval for the continuance of the kindergarten’s construction.
