AAG breaks down for second time in new year
 The Asia-America Gateway (AAG) internet cable line has been broken for the second time since the beginning of this year.
The cable connecting Viet Nam to Hong Kong broke late last week, causing slowdown in Internet connectivity.
The cause has not been diagnosed, and the repair timeline remains undetermined.
The cable was broken for the first time in 2017 in January and was finished being repaired on January 27.
In Viet Nam, network providers including FPT Telecom, Viettel, VNPT, VDC and SPT all using this cable line to connect with the international web.
VNPT said that after the incident, it opened traffic on the HCM City - Da Nang route to ensure traffic flow of international Internet in the southern region via APG and SMW3 cable.
Meanwhile, Viettel said that the Intra Asia (IA) cable system is also being repaired and was expected to be completed on Saturday, which would enhance the capacities of international connections.
