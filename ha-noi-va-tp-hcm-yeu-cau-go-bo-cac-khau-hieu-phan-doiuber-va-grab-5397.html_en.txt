There are opinions that the slogans violated competition laws which are managed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Heads of Vinasun also promised to remove the decals and slogans but many drivers still kept them to oppose Uber, Grab and Decision 24 on the pilot application of science and technology in passenger transportation by contracts permits using electronic instead of written contracts in car rent transactions.
Talking about the request to scrap Decision 24 from the Hanoi Taxi Association, Hanoi Department of Transport denied and said after the pilot project ended, they would ask the Ministry of Transport to reconsider current regulations to ensure a level playing field for all parties. Traditional taxi firms were encouraged to upgrade their technology to improve their competitiveness.
On October 9, HCM City Department of Transport asked Vinasun to remove the slogans, saying that such move was ‘not nice’ and ‘actually offensive’.
When HCM City Taxi Association opposed the shortcomings of current regulations HCM City Department of Transport said they had consulted to city people's committee to bring the issue to the Ministry of Transport.
After many taxis of Vinasun in HCM City pasted decals with the slogan that has “Uber and Grab have to conform to Vietnamese laws” or “Uber and Grab’s pilot operation must be stopped in Vietnam”, it has to face public criticism.
