U-60 inventor makes stairway for fire escape
An Inventor has made a steel ladder that can be used to exit a building in emergency cases that is comparable to similar imported products.
The heartbreaking story became an obsession for Le Quoc Khanh, an amateur inventor. Khanh wanted to create a cable ladder which allows people to escape multistory buildings in case of emergency.
Khanh, who was a seller of ladders, realized that users were afraid to step on ladders that swayed. 
Therefore, Khanh attached a belt to the ladder. At first, he created a ladder with two ropes. 
However, it had a weak point that made people feel insecure, so he made a 4-rope ladder that eliminated the shaking. 
The ladder has safety belts attached, one every three meters. In case users feet slips, they will be protected by safety belts. The stairs are made of metal.
The four-rope escape ladder is compact, but durable and safe. It is used on multistory buildings with the height of 100 meters or more. The ladder is safe for many people to use at the same time.
According to Khanh, Vietnam does not have many experts in fire escape stairs. Khanh had to create finished products with parts and accessories he bought on the market. 
An analyst noted that rope ladders sourced from South Korea are the most common products used at multistory buildings. 
However, the products have a big problem: people can only go downstairs in succession, one after another, which means that it is impossible for many people to escape at the same time.
Khanh’s ladder solves that problem. “In case of emergency, when people feel panic and try to run away as soon as possible, they don’t have to spend time to wait for their turn to use ladders,” he said.
