Hanoi to enforce registration of electric bikes
Â Hanoi Police would implement mandatory registration of electric scooters and bikes from December 6, Nguyen Manh Hung, deputy head of the Ha Noi Road and Railway Traffic Police Division, said.
Vehicle owners found violating the law after Sunday will be fined, according to Decree 171 issued by the government. 
By the middle of next year, Ha Noi Traffic Police will deal with all unregistered vehicles that are still being used. Such vehicle owners will be fined amounts ranging from VND80,000 (US$3.5) to a maximum of VND1 million ($44.4).
In addition, when electric motor vehicle owners violate traffic laws, they will be subject to other forms of punishment such as confiscation of vehicle registration papers and number plates that are not properly specified, suspension of driving licences and even confiscation of vehicles. 
Hung said in December, the traffic police in coordination with the Department of Transport in Ha Noi organised awareness programmes for drivers, and planned to launch campaigns to ensure traffic order and safety at the end of the year, and especially during the Tet holiday and Spring festivals in 2016.
In November, more than 120 accidents occurred in the city, causing 49 deaths and leaving more than 120 injured. Compared with October, the number of traffic accidents fell. But compared with 2014, the number of accident blackspots has not fallen, and there are still 44 spots facing congestion risk in urban areas.
The Traffic Police Department continues to coordinate with mobile police forces to handle traffic at key intersections to prevent traffic jams, especially at the end of the year.
