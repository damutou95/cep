Nurse may be fired for using Facebook, keeping patients waiting
Photo shows an elderly patient was being neglected, with witnesses say she is 'disrespectful' to many others
A public hospital in northern Vietnam is considering disciplinary action against a nurse who has been accused of using Facebook during work and forcing her patient to wait.  
A photo posted on Facebook on Monday showed Duong Thi Hoa, a nurse at Nam Dinh Province General Hospital, engaging in her smartphone while an elderly patient was waiting for a blood pressure check. 
The post also noted that there were other patients waiting in the line but Hoa still took time checking her Facebook page and smiling from time to time. 
The man who posted the photo said he brought his wife to the hospital because she suffered from abdominal pain. Hoa reported told his wife that “This is not the place to moan. If you need to moan, go to the emergency room.” 
He said the nurse was “disrespectful” to many other patients.  
The man shared the story with Thanh Nien reporters, who then informed the hospital. 
Hoa has admitted that she was using Facebook while receiving patients that morning. 
The hospital plans to send her to a new task pending investigation. It’s not clear what her new temporary job would be. 
Nguyen Van Hoa, director of the hospital, said it is investigating the complaint. 
“If it’s all true, she will be strictly punished. She can be even dismissed,” he said.
