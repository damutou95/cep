The Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) is finalizing a contract for a friendly football match between against a Brazil All Stars side featuring Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and others.
“Their opponents will be Vietnam All Stars,” VFF general secretary Le Hoai Anh told the media.
The match, to be played April 16 at Hanoi’s My Dinh Stadium, will be broadcast live on Fox Sports, Eurosports and YouTube, according to media reports.
Brazil is likely to also include Juliano Haus Belletti, Andre Cruz, Denilson, Djalminha, Edmilson, Elber, Emerson, Kleberson, Luizao, and Romario and will be coached by Carlos Dunga.
The Thao TV showed a signed message from Ronaldinho, the former Barcelona and AC Milan, reading, "I, Ronaldo Assis Moreira (Ronaldinho) agree to participate and play a minimum of 40 minutes in a friendly game in Vietnam. Brazil All Stars vs Vietnam All Stars between April 12-17, 2016."
Brazil All Stars are scheduled to arrive in Hanoi on April 14, meet journalists for a press briefing the same day and meet their business partners and attend a gala dinner the next day.
The match will be played April 16 before they leave the country the following day.
Anh said the list of Brazilian players has not been confirmed, adding: “The players have their schedules. They will play or not depending on negotiations.”
In 2008 the Brazilian Olympic team played a friendly against Vietnam ahead of the Beijing Olympics. The visitors, who included Ronaldinho, Pato, Anderson, Marcelo, Thiago Neves, and others beat local stars 2-0.
