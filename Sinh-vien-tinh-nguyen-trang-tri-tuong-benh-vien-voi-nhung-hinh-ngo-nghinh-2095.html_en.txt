Volunteer students decorate Ho Chi Minh City hospital wall with cartoons
Volunteer students from the Ho Chi Minh University of Architecture have recently drawn cartoon paintings on a 100-meter-long wall of a local hospital for children, capturing considerable attention from passers-by.
The colorful, lively artworks surprised many people who have passed by or visited the Pediatrics Hospital 1 on 3 Thang 2 Street, District 10.
This is among the activities conducted within the framework of “Mua He Xanh” (Green Summer), a voluntary campaign jointly organized by the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union and the Vietnamese Student Association.
Besides flowers and animals, the paintings also depict stories and characters familiar to children, such as “An Khe Tra Vang,” a Vietnamese fairy tale, and Doraemon – a robotic cat from the famous namesake Japanese comic.
“It took us four days to finish all our paintings. It’s tiring, but I’m happy to do such a meaningful thing,” Phuong Thao, a student from the university, said.
