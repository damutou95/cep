The move was based on a decision by Myanmar’s sports ministry and the martial art federation to develop the sport in the long term. 
Myanmar has supported Vietnam’s effort to include Vovinam in the competition at the 29 th SEA Games hosted by Malaysia in 2017. 
Founded in 1938, Vovinam is practised with and without weapons. It varies between hard and soft movements and requires training the body and the mind. 
Currently, the martial art has spread to more than 50 countries worldwide. 
​Four World Vovinam Championship have been organised so far, with the fourth taking place in Algeria in 2015, attracting the participation of 250 officials, referees and contestants from 20 countries worldwide.
