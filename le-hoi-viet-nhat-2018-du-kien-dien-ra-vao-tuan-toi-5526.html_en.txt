The Vietnam-Japan Festival 2018 is scheduled to take place at the September 23 Park in HCMC’s District 1 from January 26 to 28 to mark the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and Japan (1973-2018).

The three-day festival will feature a variety of cultural exchange events and traditional art programs, offering opportunities for Vietnamese people and foreign tourists to take a glimpse at unique Japanese culture and lifestyle.
Le Thanh Liem, vice chairman of the HCMC People’s Committee, last week had a meeting with Tsutomu Takebe, special advisor of the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Parliamentary Alliance and head of the organizing board, to discuss the preparation for the forthcoming festival in the city.
Liem was quoted by the Vietnam News Agency as saying that the festival was first initiated in 2014 and has become an annual event in the city with a mission to foster cultural exchange and prop up tourism cooperation between Vietnam and Japan.
On behalf of the municipal government, Liem affirmed the city government will create favorable conditions for the successful organization of the festival, which is expected to greatly strengthen the friendship and solidarity and deepen bilateral ties between the two nations.
A representative of the organizing committee told the Daily that the upcoming festival is expected to attract around 300,000 visitors, higher than the 2016 figure of 220,000.
Data from the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) shows nearly 798,000 Japanese tourists flocked to Vietnam last year, up 7.8% against a year earlier. This year, the country is pinning high hopes to lure more than one million Japanese tourist arrivals.
