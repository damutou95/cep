Vietnam to launch another satellite into orbit
According to the National Satellite Center, it is expected that this September, the satellite MicroDragon will be manufactured and available for launching in September 2017.

Through the program supporting the development of Earth observation satellites for training purposes in the developing countries of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), it is scheduled that in 2018, the Epsilon rocket (Japan) manufactured by IHI Aerospace will carry Vietnam’s MicroDragon satellite to orbit.
Dr. Pham Anh Tuan, Director of the Vietnam Space Center (VNSC), said the satellite MicroDragon with the size of 50 x 50 x 50 cm and a weight of 50 kg is being developed by the young experts of VNSC with the assistance of Japanese professors Japan, using the funds of VNSC.
The MicroDragon satellite is designed and launched to orbit with missions of observing the coastal waters to assess water quality, locate aquatic resources, track the change of phenomena occurring in the coastal waters to serve the aquaculture industry of Vietnam.
This satellite will also detect the coverage of clouds, the nature of aerosols to serve the atmospheric correction, receive sensor signals on the ground and then quickly transfer the data to the places that are very far from each other on earth. At the same time, MicroDragon will also test new materials (Atomic Oxygen, Antimony Tin Oxide Coating Solar Cell).
Tuan said, following the success of the satellite PicoDragon, VNSC sent 36 engineers to five leading Japanese universities to participate in the training course on satellite technology, and to directly design, manufacture and test the MicroDragon satellite under the guidance of Japanese professors.
With this project breakthrough, Vietnamese engineers not only have the opportunity to acquire basic knowledge about satellite technology but also to directly be involved in manufacturing the MicroDragon satellite.
Along with the help of JAXA, once the MicroDragon satellite is put into operation as expected, it will realize Vietnam’s process to master satellite technology, Tuan said.
