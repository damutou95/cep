HÀ NỘI — Some VNĐ62 trillion (US$2.7 billion) of official development aid (ODA) is the amount proposed by the Hà Nội People’s Committee to build two new railway routes in the city.
The 6km urban railway route number 2, connecting downtown Trần Hưng Đạo Street and the Thượng Định Ward in Thanh Xuân District, is expected to cost some VNĐ35 trillion ($1.5 billion), of which $1.3 billion will be funded through aid from Japan.
The system will consist of 6 underground stations passing through the Hai Bà Trưng, Đống Đa and Thanh Xuân districts, and is expected to handle 714,000 passengers per day in 2020 and 1.7 million by 2040.
The 8km urban railway route number 3, consisting of 7 stations, will connect the Hà Nội Railway Station on Lê Duẩn Street with Hoàng Mai District.
It is expected to cost some $1.2 billion, of which about $1 billion will be borrowed from foreign investors, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and is estimated to attract 488,000 passengers per day in 2020.
The construction of the routes is expected to take place from 2020-25.
The Hà Nội People’s Committee has requested that the Ministry of Planning and Investment ask for approval from the Prime Minister to use the aid from Japan and ADB for construction of the routes.
It is reported that representatives from Japan and ADB expressed their interest in sponsoring the construction of the two railway routes during meetings with Vietnamese authorities.
