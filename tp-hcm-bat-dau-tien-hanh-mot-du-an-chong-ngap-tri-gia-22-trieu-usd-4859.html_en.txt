HCM CITY – Construction on a VNĐ500 billion (US$22 million) flood-prevention project in HCM City’s District 7 is expected to start in the next quarter, according to the city’s Department of Transport.
A section of Huỳnh Tấn Phát Street, extending from Trần Xuân Soạn Street to Phú Xuân Bridge, will be built 30cm higher, while a drainage system in the section will also be replaced, according to the department’s Urban Traffic Management Zone No 4.
Construction is expected to be completed by 2018.
Heavy container trucks that travel on Huỳnh Tấn Phát Street, which leads to ports in districts 4 and 7, cause significant damage to the street.
Heavy rains and high tides often place sections of the street 0.4-0.5 metres under water.
Tidal flood control and sewer management in District 7 is included in another flood-control project, valued at VNĐ10 trillion, which is expected to be completed by 2018.
