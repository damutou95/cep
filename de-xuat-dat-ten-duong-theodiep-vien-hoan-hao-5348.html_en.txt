Street named after ‘perfect spy’ proposed
Several companies in HCM City have proposed to municipal authorities to name a street after Vietnam’s famous spy Pham Xuan An who is featured in the book X6 Perfect Spy.
First News-Tri Viet Company on September 20 inaugurated the statue of Pham Xuan An following the order from Larry Berman, the American author of the book X6 Perfect Spy.

The statue has been created by artist Lam Quang Noi, the creator of President Ho Chi Minh’s statue on the Nguyen Hue walking street in Ho Chi Minh City.
The statue was inaugurated on the occasion of the 11th ceremony to mark his death on September 20.
Author Larry Berman spent his entire royalties from the book to pay for the statue. He also expected to have a street named after Pham Xuan An in HCM City and the statue would be displayed there.
First News-Tri Viet and some other companies in HCM City have recommended the US author’s suggestion to municipal authorities to turn Cong Truong Lam Son Street to Pham Xuan An Street.
At present, the statue is being kept at First News-Tri Viet Company. 
Pham Xuan An, also known by X6, Hai Trung or Tran Van Trung, was born in 1927 and was a Vietnamese journalist and correspondent for Time magazine, Reuters and the New York Herald Tribune, stationed in Saigon during the war in Vietnam, while at the same time spying for North Vietnam.
An lived this dangerous double life for more than twenty years. The famed spy passed away on September 20, 2006.
