VN public ask schools to give students instruction for using Facebook
 Curently the public has raised concern over harmful using of the most popular social network Facebook by young people and asked schools to give them instruction on how to use Facebook usefully.
The story of 3 Vietnamese teens at the age of 13, 14 in the central province of Binh Dinh, the highlands province of Dak Lak and the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau were found creating fake Islamic State Facebook pages which has attracted social network users’ attention lately.
The Ministry of Public Security has identified that their acts are illegal but since they have shown remorse and given their young age, they will not face criminal charges; accordingly, police officers have asked the local government, families and schools to educate them.
Another story was also attracted the public’s concern is that a student tarnished the good repute of a teacher of a junior high school in the Mekong delta province of Soc Trang’s Chau Thanh District in Facebook. 
The teacher had to ask the police to find out the culprit who later only said sorry and removed the status.
As more students use Facebook in wrong way and the situation is alarming, schools need to educate them how to use social network correctly and instruct them how to use social network usefully and have good words and behaviors.
